(Do they have linkson the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</li><li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li><li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract fromit? Why?</li><li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load timereasonable?</li><li>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color orimage was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?</li><li>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was thenavigation well done?</li><li>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on allthe pages?</li><li>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?</li><li>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?</li></ol><h2>Utah National Parks</h2><a href="https://www.utah.com/destinations/national-parks">Utah National Parks page link</a><ol><li>My first impression of this site was that it seems well made with lot's of useful information about visiting national parks in the area.</li><li>The information in this website is mostly organized by national park. There is a list of links on the left for each of the main national parks, leading to pages with more details. The main body of the page on the right/center includes a short welcome summary, an interactive map of the parks across the state of Utah, and finally brief summaries of each of the featured parks. Headings and subheading make the information easy to process and find.</li><li>I find the website very intuitive in its structure. The only quirk I noticed was that the park links are organized in alphabetical order on the left. The park summaries listed under the map are also in alphabetical order, except for the Bryce Canyon summary, which falls sencond to last. For a moment I thought there was no summary included for it, because it seemed like it was skipped, but I found it as I kept scrolling.</li><li>The graphic used in the site greatly enhance it. Each park summary/page and promotional feature includes pictures of attractions in the parks. This is eye catching and helpful especially for users who are unfamiliar with the parks.</li><li>The homepage and the link all loaded very quickly within a second or two.</li><li>The color and size of all text was very easy to read and follow. Text placed over pictures included a darkened background to help the text stand out and read easier.</li><li>The site included navigation in the menu style side bar of link as well as a search bar in the top corner where you'd expect one and more clickable page headers across the top for other useful links like "Lodging", "Events", "Deals", etc.</li><li>The color scheme matched the theme perfectly and stayed consistent across the pages. More of the text and headings were a simple, but fun font in a dark gray on a simple white/gray background. Link items were colored in a blue that matched the sky in many of the park pictures and occasional uses of deep orange added contrast and matched the hues of many park rock formations depicted across the site.</li><li>A responsive design is included in the layout of this website. When manipulated to a smaller or thinner screen view, the empty peripherals start to disappear, and if shrunk further, the left side menu of links is removed.</li><li>This website does a really good job of including everything you might need to plan a trip. It doesn't just include info about the parks, but also places to stay, travel itineraries, tour guides, featured events coming up, and even local events and activities to visit in the communities around the parks. Users can find everything they need to plan their visit as well as more ideas to add to their trip.</li></body></html>
